# The Blademistress Trials v1.0
a game by cat naomi

After nearly six years, the first (private) release of Trials is here. It's still fairly buggy, but all gamebreaking bugs should be fixed, and the game should be playable and largely stable.

A few assets (sound and music most obviously) are still missing, and in a perfect world will be added to the game once they're finalized. This is likely the last code update for the forseeable future, unless some must fix bugs crop up.

Thanks everyone who joined me on this long, surprisingly perilous, and unsurprisingly silent journey. One day, inspiration willing, I'd love to come back to this project and finish it in earnest. Until then, I'd like to make it available to anyone who wants to play it, and tangible to us who have chipped in on this.
